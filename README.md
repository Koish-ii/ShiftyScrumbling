# ShiftyScrumbling
Welcome! This page will contain any and all updates for the Shifty Scrumbling modpack and server.
### *You can also find instructions on what to do with each release here. Please follow them carefully.*

## What to Do With Release Packages
**IMPORTANT**: Only use the .mrpack file if you are downloading the modpack for the first time. Otherwise, your settings and configurations will be overwritten!
Also, take care not to download the "source code" of the releases. Those don't do anything; **you're meant to grab the "Shifty Scrumbling Package" in blue coloured text.**

Releases will generally have a .mrpack file and some .jar files supplied to you. Here's an example of what that looks like in a ZIP folder:

Changes to the modpack will be marked with either *"Added"*, *"Optionally added"*, or *"Removed"*.
- "Added" means to add the mod to your existing modpack. This is done through opening the instance's folder, then going to the "mods" folder and dropping the .jar file(s) in.
- "Optionally added" means you can choose whether or not you want to use the mod. Oftentimes these optional mods will have special conditions for you to follow, such as removing another mod or changing a mod's version.
- "Removed" means to delete the mod from your existing modpack.

*Follow the labels and instructions in the release page of the ZIP folder, and everything will make sense.*

Occasionally, there may be a folder labeled "config" included with the package. This will be for situations when I need to push out a hotfix for a bug in a mod, or to adjust something that would better fit our server. To install these patched config files, simply place the config folder into the same area as your own config folder, and it will replace the necessary files with the new ones. **Make sure you do not place it into the existing config folder.**
