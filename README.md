# ShiftyScrumbling
Welcome! This page will contain any and all updates for the Shifty Scrumbling modpack and server.
### *You can also find instructions on what to do with each release here. Please follow them carefully.*

## How to Install Updates

Update packages to Shifty Scrumbling will often consist of a few things:
- A .mrpack file containing the full modpack, ready to be imported into your mod launcher
- A "mods" folder containing all new mods or versions added to the modpack
- A "config" folder for any hotfixes or new mods
- A "changelog" text file detailing the changes, and if any mods need to be removed from the modpack.

*Sometimes, an "optional" folder will be included, with mods that are said to be "Optionally added" on the release page. If you want them, place these files into the "mods" folder.*

To apply the update, navigate to the Shifty Scrumbling instance through your mod launcher, and move the **config** and **mods** folders into the main directory. When done correctly, it'll look something like this:

**IMPORTANT**: Only use the .mrpack file if you are downloading the modpack for the first time. Otherwise, your settings and configurations will be overwritten!
Also, take care not to download the "source code" of the releases. Those don't do anything; **you're meant to grab the "Shifty Scrumbling Update" in blue coloured text.**
